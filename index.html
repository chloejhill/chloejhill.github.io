    title: Diagnosing and sensemaking
    description: I am a true advocate of making sense of where you have been, uncovering your obstacles, identifying the qualities/attributes that got you here today and from here redefining your organisational and your communciations direction in more of a strategic and proactive manner. In every project I take on from creative, technical or strategic, digging deep into your context is always my starting point. Recent examples include undertaking communciations diagnostics, alongside communciations agency, HuckleBe, with a sustainability assurance standards organisation in Germany, enabling them to take the next steps towards redefining their communications direction.

    title: Strategic communications
    description: High-impact strategic communications are essential when it comes to enabling organisations to better engage target audiences, to become a more credible leader that can shift the needle of behaviour change. I have provided strategic direction, incluidng messaging and narrative work, to a multitude of different organisations including the World Bank, various UN programmes and a global flower enterprise to name just a few, where I have set them up for communications success and enabled them to elevate the impact of their projects. See more examples in <a href=" https://portfolio.chloejhill.com/strategic-comms/">my portfolio.</a>

    title: Visioning for the future
    description: So that we systematically ensure humanity’s survival on Earth, we must start balancing short-term thinking with future thinking, anticipate what is coming so we can make better decisions today that secure our collective tomorrow. To do this, I equip organisations with fresh off-the-press disruptive sustainability trends over a 10 year period which help to inform and strengthen strategic decision-making processes that help navigate the change. A recent work example includes a collaboration with Future trend advisory group, Changeist, on a social innovation project for a UK innovation foundation that enabled organisational and strategic repositioning for the next 10 years.

    title: Creative communications
    description: I believe in the power of creativity to cultivate maximum engagement with your target audiences.  Working alongside my awesome network of designers, videographers and other digital creators, I have spearheaded a range of high-impact creative communications projects  - from videos, websites, social media campaigns, brochures etc. - for various different clients from global NGOs, the Dutch Environment Ministry, the United Nations to sustainability start-ups and medium-sized enterprises looking to scale their sustainability reach and impact. See more examples in <a href=" https://portfolio.chloejhill.com/creative-content/">my portfolio.</a>

    title: Deep sustainability
    description: With a long-standing technical grounding across multiple dimensions of sustainability, particularly connected to climate resilience, food systems, regenerative agriculture and supply chains as well as natural capital investing -  I understand what it means to be sustainable and what it takes to get there. Greenwashing simply won't cut it if you want to go the distance. Deep sustainability grounding will.

    title: Conscious leadership
    description: Every engagement we have with one another is another chance to grow and learn and even wake up to the world around you and how you choose to interact with it. I challenge my clients every day assumptions and help them think more deeply about who they are as leaders and the kind of organisation they want to leave behind and the impact they want to make. Conscious leadership transcends all that do, as without reflecing on who we are as people and healing our patterns, how can we heal/look out for the planet? It all starts with us, the leaders.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Uncertain times are here</h2>
          <p>Today, we are facing several challenges, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, political and social unrest in various parts of the world, climate change, and technological disruption. It's natural to feel anxious and uncertain during times like these. However, it's important to remember that uncertainty is a fact of life, and that we can learn to cope with it. One way to do this is to focus on what we can control, such as our own actions and behaviors, rather than worrying about things that are beyond our control. It's also important to stay informed and educated about the issues that are causing uncertainty, so that we can make informed decisions and take appropriate actions. And perhaps most importantly, we can draw on our resilience, adaptability, and ability to connect with others to help us navigate through these uncertain times.</p>

          <p>Sustainability has always been my passion and my purpose. After studying the ‘socks off it’ at University with three degrees (BSc, MSc and PhD) under my belt, I then ventured across four different continents over 15 years accumulating essential experience, from the jungles of Tanzania, the reefs of Indonesia, the cloudforests of Ecuador to the protected areas of Costa Rica and Panama, the shores of Lake Geneva and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and Cambodia.</p>
          <p>Thanks to my technical background and applied multi-sectoral international experience, combined with my thirst for creativity using an array of mediums and my desire to inspire change and deliver lasting and sustainable impact across different audiences, today my focus is geared towards offering clients a delicate blend of well grounded yet creatively crafted sustainability strategies and communications that provide direction and drive that all important behaviour change.</p>
          <p>I collaborate with organizations at the international, regional, national and grassroots level  - from the United Nations to Governments, Development Banks, NGOs as well as small and medium enterprises  - working on all different facets of sustainability. I also have an awesome network of video producers, designers and other trend researchers that I work with regularly to help me create beautiful and impactful deliverables.</p>
